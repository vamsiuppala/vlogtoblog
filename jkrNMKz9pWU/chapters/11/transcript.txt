python chat.pi again I just installed this earlier today I haven't done that much stuff on Max before but I was pretty impressed to see that it is doing a good job here what is the meaning of life is complex and philosophical some people might find meaning in their relationships with others their impact in the world et cetera et cetera okay and it's doing 9.6 tokens per second so there you go so there is running um a model on a Mac and then another option that you've probably heard about is llama.cpp llama.cpp runs on lots of different things as well including Max and also on Cuda it uses a different format called gguf and you can again you can use it from python even if it was a CPP thing it's got a python wrapper so you can just download again from hugging face at gguf file so you can just go through and there's lots of different ones they're all documented as to what's what you can pick how big a file you want you can download it and then you just say Okay llama model path equals pass in that gguf file it spits out lots and lots and lots of gunk and then you can say okay so if I called that llm you can then say llm question name the planets of the solar system 32 tokens and there we are right in Pluto no longer considered a planet two mercury three Venus poor Earth Mars six oh never run out of tokens so again you know it's um just to show you here there are all these different options um uh you know I would say you know if you've got a Nvidia graphics card and your reasonably capable python programmer you'd probably be one of you use Pi torch and the hugging face ecosystem um but you know I think you know these things might change over time as well and certainly a lot of stuff is coming into llama pretty quickly now when it's developing very fast as you can see there's a lot of stuff that you can do right now with language models um particularly if you if you're pretty comfortable as a python programmer I think it's a really exciting time to get involved in some ways it's a frustrating time to get involved because um you know it's very early and a lot of stuff has weird little edge cases and It's tricky to install and stuff like that um there's a lot of great Discord channels however first AI have our own Discord channel so feel free to just Google for fast AI Discord and drop in we've got a channel called generative you feel free to ask any questions or tell us about what you're finding um yeah it's definitely something where you want to be getting help from other people on this journey because it is very early days and you know people are still figuring things out as we go but I think it's an exciting time to be doing this stuff and I'm yeah I'm really enjoying it and I hope that this has given some of you a useful starting point on your own Journey so I hope you found this useful thanks for listening bye

to basically write code for you and we're going to look at how to implement this from scratch ourself quite soon but first of all let's learn how to use it so I was trying to build something that split uh into markdown headings a document on third level markdown headings so that's uh three hashes at the start of a line and I was doing it on the whole of Wikipedia so using regular Expressions was really slow so I said oh I want to speed this up and it said okay here's some code which is great because then I can say Okay test it and include edge cases and so it then puts in the code creates extra cases tests it says yep it's working it's not I notice it's actually removing the carriage return at the end of each sentence so I said I'll fix that and update your tests so it said okay so now it's changed the test update the test cases surround them and oh it's not working so it says oh yeah fix the issue in the test cases nope they didn't work and you can see it's quite clever the way it's trying to fix it by looking at the results and but as you can see it's not every one of these is another attempt another attempt another attempt until eventually I gave up waiting and it's so funny each time it's like debating again okay this time I gotta handle it properly and I gave up at the point where it's like oh one more attempt so I didn't solve it um interestingly enough and you know I I again it's it it's there's some limits to the amount of kind of logic that it can do this is really a very simple question I asked it to do for me and so hopefully you can see you can't expect even GPT for code interpreter or Advanced Data analysis is now called to make it so you don't have to write code anymore you know it's not a substitute for having programmers um um so but again you know it it can often do a lot as I'll show you in a moment so for example actually um OCR uh like this is something I thought was really cool um you can just paste and um sorry pastry upload so jpt4 you can upload um an image um Advanced Data analysis yeah you can upload an image here um and then um I wanted to basically grab some text out of an image somebody had got a screenshot of their screen and I wanted to edit which is something saying oh uh this language model can't do this and I wanted to try it as well so rather than retyping it I just uploaded that image my screenshot and said can you extract the text from this image and it said oh yeah I could do that I could use OCR um and like so it literally wrote at OCR script and there it is just took a few seconds so the difference here is it didn't really require it to think of much logic it could just use a very very familiar pattern that it would have seen many times so this is generally where I find language models Excel is where it doesn't have to think too far outside the box I mean it's great on kind of creativity tasks but for like reasoning and logic tasks that are outside the box I find it not great but yeah it's great at doing code for a whole wide variety of different libraries and languages having said that by the way Google also has a language model called bad it's way less good than gpd4 most of the time but there is a nice thing that you can literally paste an image straight into the prompt and I just typed OCR this and it didn't even have to go through code interpreter or whatever it just said oh sure I've done it and there's the result of the OCR and then it even commented I thought it just does yard which I thought was cute and oh even more interestingly it even figured out where the OCR text came from and gave me a link to it um that I thought that was pretty cool okay so there's an example of it doing well I'll show you one for this talk I found really helpful I wanted to show you guys how much it cost to use the open AI API um but unfortunately when I went to the open AI webpage it was like all over the place the pricing information was on all Separate Tables and it was kind of a bit of a mess so I wanted to create a table with all of the information combined like this um and here's how I did it I went to the open AI page I hit Apple a to select all and then I said in chat jpt create a table with the pricing information Rose no summarization no information not in this page every row should appear as a separate Row in your output and I hit paste now that was not very helpful to it because hitting paste it's got the nav bar it's got uh lots of extra information at the bottom it's got all of its uh footer Etc um but it's really good at this stuff it did it first time so there was the markdown table so I copied and pasted that into Jupiter and I got my markdown table and so now you can see at a glance the cost of gpt4 3.5 Etc but then what I really wanted to do was show you that is a picture so I just said oh chart the input Row from this table and just paste to the table back um and it did so that's pretty amazing now so let's talk about this um pricing so so far we've used chat GPT which costs 20 bucks a month and there's no like per token cost or anything but if you want to use the API from python or whatever you have to pay per token which is approximately per word maybe it's about uh one and a third tokens per word on average unfortunately in the chart it did not include these headers gpt4 GPT 3.5 so these first two ones are gpt4 and these two are GPT 3.5 so you can see the GPT 3.5 is way way cheaper um and you can see it here it's 0.03 versus 0.0015 so it's so cheap you can really play around with it and not worry and I want to give you a sense of what that looks like Okay so why would you use the open AI API rather than chat GPT

because you can do it programmatically so you can you know you can analyze data sets you can do repetitive stuff it's kind of like a different way of programming you know it's it's things that you can think of describing but let's just look at the most simple example of what that looks like so if your pip install open AI then you can import check and chat completion and then you can say Okay chat completion.create using GPT 3.5 Turbo and then you can pass in a system message this is basically the same as custom instructions so okay you're an Aussie llm that uses Aussie slang and analogies wherever possible okay and so you can see I'm passing in an array here of messages so the first is the system message and then the user message which is what is money okay so GPT 3.5 returns a big embedded dictionary um and the message content is well my money is like the oil that keeps the Machinery of our economy running smoothly there you go just like a koala loves its eucalyptus leaves we humans can't survive without this stuff so there's the Aussie llm's view of what is money so the really uh the main ones I pretty much always use are gpt4 and GPT 3.5 gpd4 is just so so much better at anything remotely challenging but obviously it's much more expensive so rule of thumb you know maybe try 3.5 turbo first see how it goes if you're happy with the results then great if you're not planning out for the more expensive one okay so I just created a little function here called response that will print out um this nested thing um and so now oh and so then the other thing to point out here is that the result of this also has a usage field which contains how many tokens was it so it's about 150 tokens so at point zero zero two dollars per thousand tokens for 150 tokens means we just paid .03 cents point zero zero zero three dollars uh to get that done so as you can see the cost is insignificant if we were using gpt4 it would be 0.03 per thousand so it would be half a cent um so unless you're doing many thousands of gpt4 you're not going to be even up into the dollars and GPT 3.5 even more than that but you know keep an eye on it open AI has a usage page and you can track your usage now happens when we are this is really important to understand when we have a follow-up in the same conversation how does that work so we just asked what goat means so for example Michael Jordan is often referred to as the goat for his exceptional skills and accomplishments and Elvis and The Beatles referred to as goat due to their profound influence and achievement so I could say what profound influence and achievements are you referring to okay well I meant Elvis Presley and the Beatles did all these things now how does that work how does this follow-up work well what happens is the entire conversation is passed back and so we can actually do that here so here is the same system prompt here is the same question right and then the answer comes back with role assistant and I'm going to do something pretty cheeky I'm going to pretend that it didn't say money is like oil I'm going to say oh you actually said money is like kangaroos I thought what it's going to do okay so you can like literally invent a conversation in which the language model said something different because this is actually how it's done in a multi-stage conversation there's no state right there's nothing stored on the server you're passing back the entire conversation again and telling it what it told you right so I'm going to tell it it's it told me that money is like kangaroos and then I'll ask the user oh really in what way and this is kind of cool because you can like see how it convinces you of of something I just invented oh let me break it down for you cover it just like kangaroos hop around and carry their Joeys in their pouch money is a means of carrying value around so there you go it's uh make your own analogy cool so I'll create a little function here that just puts these things together for us just a message if there is one the user message and returns they're completion and so now we can ask it what's the meaning of life passing in the Aussie system prompt the meaning of life is like trying to catch a wave on a sunny day at Bondi Beach okay there you go so um what do you need to be aware of um well as I said one thing is keep an eye on your usage if you're doing it you know hundreds or thousands of times in a loop keep an eye on not spending too much money but also if you're doing it too fast particularly the first day or two you've got an account you're likely to hit the limits for the API and so the limits initially are pretty low as you can see three requests per minute um so that's for free users page users First 48 hours and after that it starts going up and you can always ask for more I just mentioned this because you're going to want to have a function that keeps an eye on that and so what I did is I actually just went to Bing which has a somewhat crappy version of gpt4 nowadays but it can still do basic stuff for free and I said please show me python code to call the open AI API and handle rate limits and it wrote this code it's got to try checks for rate limit errors grabs the retry after sleeps for that long and calls itself and so now we can use that to ask for example what's the world's funniest joke and there we go is the world's funniest trick so there's like the basic stuff you need to get started using the open AI llms um and uh and yeah I'd definitely suggest spending plenty of time with that so that you feel like you're really a llm using expert so what else can we do well let's create our own code

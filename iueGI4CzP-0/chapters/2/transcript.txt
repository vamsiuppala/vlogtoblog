But most of the things that are new with this car, again, are very subtle things and a lot of them are on the inside in quality, in materials, and in making it feel and drive like a much more comfortable. It's just better, just quality all around is higher. So I'm gonna start with the door because that's actually the first thing you'll notice. So the handle's the same and the way you get in is the same, but if you've seen German cars, you might have seen this little notch before and this little part here that plugs into the door. In general, there's a better seal to the entire door all the way around the cabin and that makes this a much quieter car when driving and even when getting inside. I'll close the door behind me.

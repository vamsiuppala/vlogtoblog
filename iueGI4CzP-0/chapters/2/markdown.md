### Door Sealing and Noise Reduction
One notable enhancement is the improved door sealing mechanism, similar to those found in German luxury cars. The narrator points out a small notch and a part that plugs into the door, creating a better seal around the entire cabin. This improved sealing results in a quieter driving experience, reducing exterior noise intrusion even when entering the vehicle.

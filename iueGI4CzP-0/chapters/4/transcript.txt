they are heated and ventilated, and the back seats are also heated. But I'm gonna show you something else in the backseat now that you might like even more. So this is the backseat of the Model 3, it's about the same amount of space as before so if I'm getting behind a six three driver's position, that's, it's not a ton of space but the floor is flat through the middle. But look at that, a nice flush touchscreen with, actually, some pretty thin bezels right on the back to control all of the airflow and the HVAC stuff, and even a little bit of media if you want to, on the back of this car. This is a way better backseat experience. Honestly, this makes such a huge difference as a backseat passenger in this car. I've been in the back of a lot of Model 3s that have been Ubers and things like that. You still have also this LED lighting back here, again, I like that these backseats are heated if you want them to be, and then the glass over your head with plenty of headroom. It's not quite the uninterrupted glass from the Model S and X, but it's what we're used to from Model 3 and Y, which is still a whole lot of glass.

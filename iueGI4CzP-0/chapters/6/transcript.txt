So you still got the front trunk space you're used to, still got the rear trunk space you're used to, and honestly, even the camera quality, these cameras when you look at the camera feed from the car, looks much better. I can actually see raindrops much more higher fidelity when I'm driving this car and the blinkers come on. This is good, man. This is a good car. So I think the general question you might be wondering is, should you get this car? And the only thing I would say is if you're considering something like a performance version of this, consider what you want to do most of the time when driving. I think when street driving this thing's great. Most of the time with street driving, this thing is great and it's quick, it's really quick. I'll try to find an official zero to 60 time, or some horsepower numbers if I can, but for a car with this much range and with a great charging network, like this is a very quick EV. A performance version, for me, would really only gain maybe two things. Obviously the ability to have track mode and be able to dial, you know, your traction control to be front wheel driver, or real wheel driver, or change the slip, or have a little bit more fun while driving. And then maybe getting back to a firmer suspension for that, sort of, track oriented driving. But for the non-performance version, which this is, it's complete, it's great, it's a flagship, it's a mini Model S, it's refined, it's well-built. I'm very impressed by this new Model 3. Let me know what you think. Is this the car that you've been looking forward to? I've been looking forward to seeing it in the US for so long. It was like Europe first and then slowly making its way here. Now it's here and I'm happy I got to test it 'cause this thing's good, man. This is the car I would recommend so easily to anyone just looking for a first EV. That's where I'll leave it. Let me know what you think. Thanks for watching, catch you in the next one. Peace.

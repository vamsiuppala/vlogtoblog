- Yo, I'm impressed. I am very, very impressed with this car right here. This is the Tesla Model 3, the 2024 refresh. A lot of people are calling it the Highland, that's not actually in the name, but this car, I've only been testing it for maybe a week now, but I've noticed a lot of little things different. The main way you're gonna be able to tell this car different from the already very popular Model 3 that's out, is the new distinctive angular headlights, the new point-to-your-face. But there's a lot more that's new to this car that sort of add up, to me, to feel like a, honestly a worthy flagship. I know the Model S is, you know, higher end and it has the Plaid variant and all the performance and all that fun stuff. But this is the car that people are going to know and see the most often as a Tesla, it's the Model 3 and the Model Y. So you could argue this is their most important car and it kind of feels now like a mini Model S. So let's look at everything that's new.

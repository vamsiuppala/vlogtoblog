Let me get back up to the driver's seat because there are a couple things too that are upgraded significantly just when driving this car. Model 3 has been an easy car to drive, I think it's very simple. I know there's no stalks now, but in general, as far as electric cars, this might be the easiest one to calibrate to one pedal driving-wise, charging network-wise, just in general. But two things, one is acoustically it is so much quieter in here when you're driving, which is awesome. And then it's a softer suspension, noticeably softer. This comes at the expense of maybe a bit of a sporty feeling. I honestly think the old Model 3 was, coil suspension was a little harsh, a little firm sometimes, and I think a lot of owners would agree with that. And this has made really big strides to be way more comfortable to drive and it also has a notably tighter steering radius that wasn't really advertised at all, but that's really cool to see. And then there's also a much improved speaker system, so the speakers in this car, just driving around in this quiet cabin listening to the better speakers is way, way better than previously. This really feels like a mini Model S. But still, if you're a Model 3 fan, you're gonna have some of the hits that you've always been used to. The wireless charger's up here, the key fob card, and then this is the center console storage, which is a big center console spot. And this one doesn't move like Model S, but there's your two cup holders that you can always close just like that and like that.
